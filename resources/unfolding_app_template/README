unfolding_app_template
======================

This is a skeleton for how to use unfolding in eclipse.  You only need to
import ('File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace', select this
folder, 'Finish') this folder in eclipse and everything should work.

A few unfolding demos are included as well.


Get excited and make things!
