## Unfolding Overview
Download the latest version of the [Unfolding library](https://github.com/tillnagel/unfolding/downloads "Download Unfolding") at Github.  
Unzip the archive and put the extracted Unfolding folder into the libraries folder of your Processing sketches.  

To find the Processing sketches location on your computer, open the Preferences window of the 
Processing application and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top. 
You will need to create the "libraries" folder if this is your first contributed library. 

Unfolding also needs the library GLGraphics to simplify the handling of OpenGL. Download the [GLGraphics library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/glgraphics/ "GLGraphics"), unzip it and put the GLGraphics folder in the libraries folder.

Restart Processing, start a new sketch and create your first simple map.
