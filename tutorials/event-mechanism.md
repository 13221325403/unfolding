- simple interactions 

- EventDispatcher
- mouse, keyboard, and tuioHandler

- own eventdispatcher
	with own broadcast and register

- used for multiple maps
	- fire own events (e.g. new event(pan, loc)), instead of calling map.pan()

- example: complex event mechanism
	use DebugDisplay to see events
